## Usage

Once this action is enabled, bot will create a comment for each Pull Request with a list of all changed tests.

This information is useful to:

- track addition and removal of tests
- protect from skipping tests
- protect from using `.only` exclusive tests
- automatically mark PR with `has tests` or `no tests` labels
- review tests on GitHub

## Installation

Check that your project uses one of the following testing frameworks (this list will be extended).

**Supported testing frameworks**

- codeceptjs
- cypress.io
- jasmine
- jest
- mocha
- [nigthwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org)
- protractor
- testcafe

Add this action to your workflow file `.github/workflow/main.yml` and configure.

```yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Check Tests
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: testomatio/check-tests@stable
        with:
          framework: # REQUIRED - testing framework
          tests: # REQUIRED - glob pattern to match test files
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

> It is important to enable `actions/checkout@v2` step with `fetch-depth: 0` to allow testomatio to compare tests in pull requests with tests in base.

#### Inputs (Configuration)

- `framework` - _(required)_ Test framework to be used. Supported: mocha, codeceptjs'
- `tests` - _(required)_ Glob pattern to match tests in a project, example: `tests/**_test.js'`
- `token` - _(should be: `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`)_ GitHub token to post comment with summary to current pull request
- `typescript` - enable TypeScript support
- `has-tests-label` - add a label when PR contains new tests. Set `true` or a label name to enable.
- `no-tests-label` - add a label when PR contains no new tests. Set `true` or a label name to enable.
- `comment-on-empty` - post a comment to PR when no tests added. Can be either boolean (for neutral message) or a custom message within a comment (markdown supported)
- `close-on-empty` - close PR when no tests added. Use with `comment-on-empty` to clarify this action
- `comment-on-skipped` - add custom message when new tests are skipped (markdown supported).
- `close-on-skipped` - close PR when introduced skipped tests. Use with `comment-on-skipped` to clarify this action
- `enable-documentation` - If set to `true`, test document will be created in wiki.
- `wiki-doc-name` - Name of the wiki document. By default it will use `Test Document`
- `documentation-branch` - Branch to create document on push. Uses default branch if this field is empty
- `github-pat` - Github Private access token to create document in wiki.

### Examples

#### For creating test document

This example uses jest as example. Tests are located in `tests/` directory. You can generate GH_PAT [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and add the generated token in secrets of your repo.

If documentation branch is not provided, it will consider default branch of the repo.

      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      comment-on-skipped: "## Don't mark tests as skipped!"
      close-on-skipped: true
```

## CLI

Use this checker as CLI tool with any Continuous Integration service.

Run `check-tests` via npx:

```sh
npx check-tests <framework> "<tests>" --no-skipped
```

### Development

To change host of endpoint for receiving data, and set it to other than app.testomat.io use TESTOMATIO_URL environment variable:

TESTOMATIO_URL=http://local.testomat.io

> This checker will fail a build if exclusive tests (with `.only` or `fit` or `fdescribe` found)

### Arguments:

- test framework
- glob pattern to match tests in a project, example: `tests/**_test.js'`. **It is important to include glob pattern in double quotes `"` so wildcard could be used correctly.**

### CLI Options:

- `--no-skipped` - fail when skipped tests found
- `--typescript` - enable typescript support
- `-g, --generate-file <fileName>` - Export test details to document
- `-u, --url <url>`, Github URL to get file link (URL/tree/master)

### Example

Check tests for CodeceptJS

```
npx check-tests codeceptjs "tests/**_test.js"
```

Check tests for Protractor

```
npx check-tests protractor "spec/**.spec.js"
```

Check tests for Protractor with TypeScript

```
npx check-tests protractor "spec/**.spec.ts" --typescript
```

Check tests for Cypress.io

```
npx check-tests cypress "cypress/integration/**.js"
```

Check tests for Testcafe

```
npx check-tests testcafe "tests/**.js"
```

### Sample Output

List CodeceptJS tests

When found `.only` test:

```
‚úó npx check-tests mocha "test/**/**_test.js"

[[ Tests checker by testomat.io ]]
Error: Exclusive tests detected. `.only` call found in test/checkout/important_test.js:290
Remove `.only` to restore test checks

```

## Using in Testomatio

This library is used by [Testomatio](https://testomat.io) to import tests.

## Importing Into Project

Use `TESTOMATIO` environment variable with a valid API key to import data into a project.
API key can be obtained on project settings page or on "Import From Source" page.

For example:

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"

```

### Test code

By default, check-test sends the code of the test hooks to the "client": before, beforeEach and after.
In the "Codes" section you can see all the additional "context" of the test (Testomat.io).

To exclude hook code from a client test, use the --no-hooks option

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --no-hooks
```

### Additional line number to the test code

To include line number code from a client test, use --line-numbers option.
_(By default Code section exclude "line number")_

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --line-numbers
```

## Import Parametrized Tests

It is possible to import parametrized tests if they use template literals with variables in thier names:

```js
['one', 'two', 'three'].forEach(() => {
  it(`this is test number ${parameter}`);
});
```

This test will be imported with its original name including a placeholder:

```
this is test number ${parameter}
```

When executed test will be reported with 3 results matched to the same test and param values will be added to the report.

## Disable Detached Tests

If a test from a previous import was not found on next import it is marked as "detached".
This is done to ensure that deleted tests are not staying in Testomatio while deleted in codebase.

To disable this behavior and don't mark anything on detached on import use `--no-detached` option

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --no-detached
```

This option could also be set via environment variable `TESTOMATIO_NO_DETACHED=1`.
If you don't want to pass it each time, create .env file in the root dir of your project with this variable set.

## Synchronous Import

By default `check-tests` doesn't wait for all tests to be processed. It sends request to Testomatio and exits. To wait for processing to finish use `--sync` option.

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --sync
```

Please note, that this will take a long time on a large codebase.

## Auto-assign Test IDs in Source Code

To disable guess matching for tests it is recommend to use Testomatio IDs to map a test in source code to a test in Testomatio. Testomatio IDs can be put automatically into the test names into source code when `--update-ids` option is used:

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --update-ids
```

Tests imported with `--update-ids` will be processed in synchronouse mode, so the script will finish after all tests are processed.

## Keep Test IDs Between Projects

To import tests with Test IDs set in source code into another project use `--create` option. In this case, a new project will be populated with the same Test IDs.

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --create
```

Without `--create` import will fail with a message that ID was not found.

## Clean Test IDs

If you want to import the synced project as new project, you have to clean the test ids.
To clean up test ids without connecting to Testomatio project use `--purge` option:

```
npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --purge
```

This method may be unsafe, as it cleans all `@S*` and `@T*` tags from tests and suites. So if you have a tag like `@Test1234` this may also be removed. If you use this option make sure if all the test titles a proper before committing the tests in GIT.

> **Note:** `--purge` is an alias of `--unsafe-clean-ids` option.

To clean only test ids set from a specific project use `--clean-ids` option instead:

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --clean-ids
```

TESTOMATIO is API key of a project with existing test ids.

## Import Into a Branch

Tests can be imported into a specific branch if `TESTOMATIO_BRANCH` parameter is used.
Branch is matched by its id. If branch was not found, it will be created.

```
TESTOMATIO_BRANCH=dev TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"
```

## Keep Structure of Source Code

When tests in source code have IDs assigned and those tests are imported, Testomat.io uses current structure in a project to put the tests in. If folders in source code doesn't match folders in Testomat.io project, existing structure in source code will be ignored. To force using the structure from the source code, use `--keep-structure` flag on import:

```
TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --keep-structure
```

## Delete Empty Suites

If tests were marked with IDs and imported to already created suites in Testomat.io
newly imported suites may become empty. Use `--no-empty` option to clean them up after import.

```
TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --no-empty
```

> This prevents usage --keep-structure option.

## Import Into a Specific Suite

To put all imported tests into a specific suite (folder) pass in `TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR` environment variable:

```
TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR="MyTESTS" TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"
```

This will use "MyTests" folder in a root of a project or create it if it doesn't exist.

It is also possible to specify a suite by its SID:

```
TESTOMATIO_SUITE="1111111" TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"
```

or use SID with prefix:

```
TESTOMATIO_SUITE="S1111111" TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"
TESTOMATIO_SUITE="@S1111111" TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"
```

## Remove Path Prefixes

Use `TESTOMATIO_WORKDIR` to avoid redundant folder nesting:

```bash
# Problem: src/tests/API/ creates nested paths in Testomat.io
# Solution: Set working directory to remove src/tests prefix
TESTOMATIO_WORKDIR=src/tests TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests playwright "**/*.spec.ts"

# Monorepo: Import without parent paths
TESTOMATIO_WORKDIR=apps/frontend TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests jest "**/*.test.js"
```

## Group Tests by Category

Use `TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR` to organize tests:

```bash
# Group API tests under "API Tests" folder
TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR="API Tests" TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests jest "src/api/**/*.test.js"

# Separate by team
TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR="Frontend Team" TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests playwright "tests/ui/**/*.spec.ts"
```

## Import to Specific Suite

Use `TESTOMATIO_SUITE` to target existing suites:

```bash
# Import to existing suite by SID
TESTOMATIO_SUITE=S1234567 TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests jest "features/**/*.test.js"
```

## TypeScript

For TypeScript projects `@babel/core` and `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript` packages are used. GitHub Action already contains those modules, while CLI version of this tool tries to automatically install them on first run.

If you face issues parsing TypeScript file menitioning `@babel/core` or `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript` try to install them manually:

```
npm i @babel/core @babel/plugin-transform-typescript --save-dev
```

Now tests TypeScript can be imported with `--typescript` option:

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js" --typescript
```

## Test aliases

Test aliases are used to map tests in source code to tests in Testomat.io. By default `test` and `it` are parsed. But if you rename them or use another function to define tests (e.g. created/extended test object in Playwright), you can add alias (or multiple aliases, separated by comma) via `--test-alias` option:

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests Playwright "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.ts" --test-alias myTest,myCustomFunction
```

## Programmatic API

Import Analyzer from module:

```js
const { Analyzer } = require('check-tests');

const framework = 'jest';
const pathToTests = './tests';
const pattern = '**/*[._-]{test,spec}.{ts,js}';

const analyzer = new Analyzer(framework, pathToTests);

// to enable typescript...
analyzer.withTypeScript();

// to enable babel plugins
analyzer.addPlugin('@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx');
analyzer.addPlugin('@babel/plugin-syntax-flow');

// to enable babel presets
analyzer.addPreset('@babel/preset-react');
analyzer.addPreset('@babel/preset-flow');

analyzer.analyze(pattern);

// stats on processed files
const stats = analyzer.stats;

// full info on parsed tests
const data = analyzer.rawTests;
```

## Debugging

Run import with `DEBUG="testomatio:*"` environment variable to get additional logs which may help understanding the cause of an issue. Usually it may happen because of a specific file that couldn't be parsed:

```
DEBUG="testomatio:*" npx check-tests@latest ....
```
